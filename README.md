R package to use Google's gemini via API on R

## Terms

Before use the API, I recommend that you to check at least the following.
- [Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)
- [Gemini API Additional Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms)

There may be more terms and conditions that you need to check.
Any app which uses the API should be compliant with the Google Terms of Service.

## Installation

#### From CRAN
```r
install.packages("gemini.R")
```

#### From [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/) (development version)

```r
install.packages("gemini.R",
  repos = c("https://jhk0530.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

#### From Github (development version)

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jhk0530/gemini.R")
```

## Usage

#### gemini with text

``` r
library(gemini.R)

setAPI("your API key") # check https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
gemini("Explain about the gemini in astrology in one line")

# text 
# "Gemini, the third astrological sign, is associated with 
# communication, adaptability, and a thirst for knowledge." 

```

#### gemini with image

``` r

# uses default prompt as "Explain this image"
# uses included image of gemini.R package
gemini_image(image = system.file("docs/reference/figures/image.png", package = "gemini.R"))

# text 
# " The image shows a table with a white tablecloth. On the table are two cups of coffee, 
# a bowl of blueberries, and five scones. The scones are covered in blueberries and have 
# a crumbly texture. There are also some pink flowers on the table. The background is a 
# dark blue color. The image is taken from a top-down perspective." 

```

#### gemini with image via Shiny

To use `gemini_image` function, image file required. 
and I recommend to use shiny app with `fileInput` function.

``` r
library(shiny)
library(gemini.R)

setAPI("YOUR KEY")
ui <- fluidPage(
  sidebarLayout(
    NULL,
    mainPanel(
      fileInput(
        inputId = "file",
        label = "Choose file to upload",
      ),
      imageOutput(outputId = "image1"),
      textInput(
        inputId = "prompt", 
        label = "Prompt", 
        placeholder = "Enter Prompts Here"
      ),
      actionButton("goButton", "Ask to gemini"),
      textOutput("text1")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  observeEvent(input$file, {
    path <- input$file$datapath
    output$image1 <- renderImage({
      list(
        src = path
      )
    }, deleteFile = FALSE)
  })
  
  observeEvent(input$goButton, {
    output$text1 <- renderText({
      gemini_image(input$prompt, input$file$datapath)
    })
  })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```
