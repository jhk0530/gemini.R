### Quick start

You can use sample audio file from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/hello%20world/)

Note, `gemini_audio` will use **"Describe this audio"** as default prompt.

```r
library(gemini.R)
gemini_audio(audio = "helloworld.mp3")

# text
# "The audio contains a clear, crisp recording of a person saying \"Hello\".
# Following the phrase is a distinct, repeated percussive sound, possibly a rhythmic
# tapping or clicking noise. The sound is consistent and mechanical in nature.\n"

```
