## Goal

<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
    <img src='gemini-intro.png' width = '80%'>
</p>

The goal of `gemini.R` is to make it easy to use Google's Gemini API in R.

## Quick Start

To use the Gemini API, you need to create and save an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). The Gemini API offers both free and paid plans.

It is recommended to use the `setAPI` function to securely save and use your Gemini API key in your environment.

```r
library(gemini.R)
setAPI("YOUR_API_KEY")
gemini("Explain about the gemini in astrology in one line")

# text
# "Gemini, the third astrological sign, is associated with
# communication, adaptability, and a thirst for knowledge."
```

## Features

Most functions provided by `gemini.R` are based on the [Gemini API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini).

`gemini.R` primarily implements features from the Gemini API, with some additional support for Vertex AI features.

If a feature is not yet implemented or mentioned, it is not currently planned for `gemini.R`. Not all features of the Gemini API will be included, but the most important ones will be prioritized.
